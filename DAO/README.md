# Decentralized Publishing Organization (DPO) DAO Model
DPO introduces different user roles - Reader, Author, Reviewer, and Editor. This DAO model allows users to progress from Reader to Editor through a blockchain-based governance mechanism.

## How it Works
1. Token allocation: On joining, users receive 1000 tokens, representing their stake and voting power.
2. Proposal creation: Users can propose role promotion using these tokens.
3. Voting: All token-holding members can vote 'for', 'against', or 'abstain'. Voting power is determined by token count.
4. Proposal execution: If approved, role changes are implemented, and user's role is upgraded. On promotion, the token count is updated, reflecting the new role and responsibility.
## Architecture
Our system uses smart contracts written in Solidity.

- Governor Contract: Handles voting, setting the voting period, handling quorum, etc. It includes a proposal counter (s_proposalCount).
- TimeLock Contract: Provides mechanisms for delayed execution, enabling future-dated contract calls.
- UserRoles Contract: Manages user roles. Each address has a specific role assigned, manageable by the contract owner.
- GovernanceToken Contract: ERC20Votes-based token system allows users to claim, mint, or burn tokens.
## Conclusion
This DAO-based DPO model offers a transparent, democratic, and secure way to manage user roles. The decentralized system, using blockchain and smart contracts, ensures all actions are permanently recorded and consensus-based.
