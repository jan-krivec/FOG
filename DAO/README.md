# DAO Microservice Architecture for Voting Reviewers
This folder contains the smart contract implementation for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) microservice architecture for voting reviewers for journal organizations.

The smart contract is written in Solidity and utilizes the OpenZeppelin library to implement governance mechanisms.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To use this smart contract, you will need the following:
- An Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask
- Access to the Ethereum network
- Installation
- To use the smart contract, you can simply copy the code and deploy it on your preferred Ethereum network.

Alternatively, you can use the code as a starting point to develop your own DAO microservice architecture.

## How It Works
The smart contract implements the following features:
1. Members can propose new reviewers for the organization to vote on.
2. Each proposal can either be open to all members or only to members with a specific role.
3. Members can cast votes on proposals that they are eligible to vote on.
4. The proposal is accepted if it receives a majority of the votes.
5. Smart Contract Details
6. The smart contract implements the following contracts from the OpenZeppelin library:
    - Governor
    - GovernorCountingSimple
    - GovernorVotes
    - GovernorVotesQuorumFraction
    - AccessControl

### Governor
This contract is responsible for managing proposals and votes.

###  GovernorCountingSimple
This contract provides a simple vote counting mechanism.

###  GovernorVotes
This contract provides functions for voting and retrieving vote counts.

###  GovernorVotesQuorumFraction
This contract implements a quorum threshold based on a fraction of the total supply of tokens.

### AccessControl
This contract provides role-based access control.

### Additional Functions
The smart contract also implements the following additional functions:
- assignRoleToProposal: This function allows the admin to assign a role to a proposal.
- _castVote: This function checks if the voter is eligible to vote on the proposal and then casts the vote.
